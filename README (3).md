# EDA - Students Performance Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis of Students Performance in Exams dataset containing 1000 student records with demographic information and exam scores.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform complete EDA following best practices
- Identify patterns and relationships in student performance
- Prepare data for machine learning modeling
- Generate actionable insights for educational institutions

## 📁 Dataset Information
- **Source**: Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams
- **Records**: 1000 students
- **Features**: 8 attributes including demographics and scores
- **Target Variables**: Math, Reading, and Writing scores

## 🔧 Features Analyzed
- **Demographic**: Gender, Race/Ethnicity
- **Educational**: Parental education level, Test preparation
- **Scores**: Math, Reading, Writing (0-100 scale)

## 📈 Key Insights

### 1. Data Quality
- ✅ No missing values or duplicates
- ✅ No erroneous data detected
- ✅ Well-structured dataset

### 2. Performance Patterns
- 📚 Reading and Writing scores are highly correlated (0.95)
- 🧮 Math scores show different distribution pattern
- 👩 Female students excel in verbal subjects
- 👨 Male students perform slightly better in math

### 3. Influencing Factors
- 🎯 Test preparation significantly improves scores
- 🏫 Parental education level impacts student performance
- 🍽 Lunch type (standard vs free/reduced) affects scores

### 4. Statistical Findings
- All scores follow approximately normal distribution
- Moderate outliers present in all subjects
- Strong gender-based performance differences

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scipy, scikit-learn
- plotly (for interactive visualizations)
